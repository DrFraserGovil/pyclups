Installation
=============

At present, ``pyclups`` must be installed via the source distribution (`https://github.com/DrFraserGovil/pyclups`__):


.. sourcecode:: bash

   $ git clone https://github.com/DrFraserGovil/pyclups

This can then either be added to your path:

.. sourcecode:: bash

	$ export PATH=$PATH:/path/to/pyclups

Or installed using the normal ``pip`` mechanisms:

.. sourcecode:: bash

	$ pip install /path/to/pyclups
