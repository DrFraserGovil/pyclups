# pyclups: Constrained, Linear, Unbiased Predictor-Sequences

`pyclups` is a Python module which allows one to construct and fit a CLUPS to a set of provided data, as described in *Fraser-Govil \& Gration (2024).

The CLUPS is a modified form of the standard Best Linear (Unbiased) Predictor - the BL(U)P - which allows one to place firm constraints on the nature of the predictions, such as monotonicity, bounds, integral-norming and so on.
